1. Components Overview

Client Layer

Cursor AI (LLM IDE Assistant)
Converts natural language requirements into Playwright test scripts and refactors tests.

MCP Clients (e.g., Claude Desktop, VS Code MCP extension)
Interfaces between the LLM and the automation server using MCP tool calls.

Server Layer

MCP Server for Playwright
Exposes Playwright automation as standard MCP tools, such as:

run_test(test_name)

generate_test(requirement)

list_tests()

get_test_report(test_id)

Execution Layer

Playwright Test Runner
Executes browser automation tests. Integrates with CI/CD pipelines.

Infrastructure / Support

Browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps)

Test Artifacts (Screenshots, Videos, Trace Logs)

2. Flow of Operations

QA or developer writes a natural language test requirement.

Cursor AI receives the requirement and generates Playwright test scripts.

Cursor AI communicates with the MCP Server via MCP tool calls.

MCP Server invokes the Playwright Test Runner to execute the test.

Playwright runs the test in the target browser (Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit).

Execution results (pass/fail, screenshots, logs) are returned to the MCP Server.

MCP Server sends results back to Cursor AI via the MCP client.

Cursor AI analyzes results, suggests fixes, and refines tests.

QA or developer reviews results and updates requirements.

3. Tools Required

Cursor AI → LLM-powered IDE assistant.

MCP Clients → Claude Desktop, VS Code MCP extension, or similar.

MCP Server for Playwright → Custom MCP adapter exposing automation tools.

Playwright (@playwright/test) → Functional test automation engine.

Browsers → Chromium, Firefox, WebKit.

CI/CD → GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps.

Test Artifacts → Screenshots, videos, HTML trace logs.
